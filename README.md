# To the reviewer:

I believe I fixed the issue with not having “The useEffect() hooks have the appropriate dependencies listed in the dependency array”.
If you still think there is a problem, could you please specify which file is affected? I went over the code with my mentor. He thinks everything looks good.
Respectfully,
Elena
